# Medical_Insurance

# Introduction
Medical insurance, also known as health insurance, is a crucial financial tool that helps individuals manage the cost of healthcare expenses. It provides coverage for medical, hospitalization, and surgical expenses, as well as preventive care, prescription drugs, and other healthcare services. Medical insurance provides individuals and families with financial protection against the high costs of medical treatments, hospital stays, surgeries, and other healthcare services.

# Dataset Description
The Medical Insurance dataset contains 1338 rows and 7 columns. The columns in the dataset are defined below:

Attributes of the dataset

• age: age of primary beneficiary

• sex: insurance contractor gender: female or male

• bmi: body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height

• children: number of children covered by health insurance

• smoker: yes or no

• region: the payees' residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest

• medicalCost: individual medical costs billed by medical insurance.

# Tool
The tool used for this task is Jupyter Notebook.

# Task
The task is to use machine learning to build a prediction model to estimate the medical cost of individuals based on the predicters given in the dataset. Use the data science methodology to achieve the task. The following questions need to be answered:

a) Is the required ML supervised, unsupervised, or semi supervised learning and why? Which ML task (classification, clustering, regression analysis or any other) is the best in this case and why?

b) Explore data and document your observation.

c) Study the correlation between each predictor and the medicalCost and state conclusion.

d) Use the correlation analysis to select 3 best predictors and build a simple linear regression model based on each of the predictors.

e) Evaluate the performance with the statistical performance measures to evaluate the statistical significance of your results.

f) Build two multivariate regression models 1) with the three predictors above and 2) with all the predictors in the dataset. Evaluate and compare the two models.

g) State your overall conclusions for this task
